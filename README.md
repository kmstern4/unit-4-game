### About
This game was created as an assignment for the bootcamp I attended. Each crystal is assigned a random number at the start of the game. A target number is also randomly generated. Click on the crystals to try and achieve the target number. If you go above the target score, you lose. If you match the target number, you win. Either, way the game then begins again, with new values for the crystals and a new target number. The frame for this page was created using the CSS grid system.
